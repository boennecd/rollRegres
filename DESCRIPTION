Description: Methods for fast rolling and expanding linear regression models. That is, series of linear regression models estimated on either an expanding window of data or a moving window of data. The methods use rank-one updates and downdates of the upper triangular matrix from a QR decomposition (see Dongarra, Moler, Bunch, and Stewart (1979) <doi:10.1137/1.9781611971811>).
