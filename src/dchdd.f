C
c     dchdd downdates an augmented cholesky decomposition or the
c     triangular factor of an augmented qr decomposition.
c     specifically, given an upper triangular matrix r of order p,  a
c     row vector x, a column vector z, and a scalar y, dchdd
c     determineds a orthogonal matrix u and a scalar zeta such that
c
c                        (r   z )     (rr  zz)
c                    u * (      )  =  (      ) ,
c                        (0 zeta)     ( x   y)
c
c     where rr is upper triangular.  if r and z have been obtained
c     from the factorization of a least squares problem, then
c     rr and zz are the factors corresponding to the problem
c     with the observation (x,y) removed.  in this case, if rho
c     is the norm of the residual vector, then the norm of
c     the residual vector of the downdated problem is
c     dsqrt(rho**2 - zeta**2). dchdd will simultaneously downdate
c     several triplets (z,y,rho) along with r.
c     for a less terse description of what dchdd does and how
c     it may be applied, see the linpack guide.
c
c     the matrix u is determined as the product u(1)*...*u(p)
c     where u(i) is a rotation in the (p+1,i)-plane of the
c     form
c
c                       ( c(i)     -s(i)     )
c                       (                    ) .
c                       ( s(i)       c(i)    )
c
c     the rotations are chosen so that c(i) is double precision.
c
c     the user is warned that a given downdating problem may
c     be impossible to accomplish or may produce
c     inaccurate results.  for example, this can happen
c     if x is near a vector whose removal will reduce the
c     rank of r.  beware.

c                nz is the number of vectors to be downdated
c                nz may be zero, in which case z, y, and rho

c                y contains the scalars for the downdating

c
c         info   integer.
c                info is set as follows.
c
c                   info = 0  if the entire downdating
c                             was successful.
c
c                   info =-1  if r could not be downdated.
c                             in this case, all quantities
c                             are left unaltered.
c
c                   info = 1  if some rho could not be
c                             downdated.  the offending rhos are
